Description: Implementation of the Edge Selection Algorithm for undirected graph selection.  The least angle regression-based algorithm selects edges of an undirected graph based on the projection of the current residuals on the two dimensional edge-planes.  The algorithm selects symmetric adjacency matrix, which many other regression-based undirected graph selection procedures cannot do.
